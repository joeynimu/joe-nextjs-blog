<p>
  In this post, we will look at how you can use react-query with a graphql based
  API.
</p>
<p>By the end, you will be able to;</p>

- Install, and set up react-query.
- Send a graphql request using the fetch API.
- Use react-query to fetch data from a graphql API
- Fetch some graphql jobs listing and display them

<p>
  Before we get started, you will need to have a react app that you will use. I
  will use an app bootstrapped with CRA in this tutorial, but you can use any
  React application; Nexjs, Gatsby, CRA, etc.
</p>

<p>Let's get started</p>

##### Installing react-query and setting it up

<p>We will install react-query by running;</p>

```bash
 $ yarn add react-query
```

<p>
  Next, we need need to wrap our app with QueryClientProvider and provide a
  queryClient instance
</p>

```jsx:title
// index.js file

import { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";
import App from "./App";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </StrictMode>,
  rootElement
);
```

<p>And with that, our app is now ready to use ReactQuery's hooks.</p>

##### Making a Graphql request using fetch

<p>
  We will use the{" "}
  <a href="https://api.graphql.jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    open graphql jobs API
  </a>
  as our backend, and to make the request, we will use the fetch API.
</p>

<p>
  Below is a signature function of making a graphql request using fetch,
  accepting a query, making the request, and returning the data.
</p>

```js
const fetchData = async (query) => {
  /* pass in a query string e.g
    const query = `
      query queryName{
        ...
      }
    `
  */
  const API_URL = "https://api.graphql.jobs/"; // <-- your graphql API url
  const res = await fetch(API_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query,
    }),
  });
  const data = await res.json();
  return data;
};
```

Let's define a query string as below;

```js
const GRAPHQL_JOBS_QUERY = `
  query JobsQuery{
    jobs{
      id
      title
      description
    }
  }
`;
```

<p>
  We will then modify our fetchData function slightly to return the correct data
  key as below;
</p>

```js
 ..
 return data.data.jobs
 ..
```

#### Using react-query to make a Graphql request

<p>We will first import useQuery from react-query</p>

```js
import { useQuery } from "use-query";
```

<p>We can then pass our function to react-query's use-query hook.</p>

```js
const {
  data: jobs = [],
  isLoading,
  isError,
} = useQuery("graphql-jobs", async () => fetchData(GRAPHQL_JOBS_QUERY));
```

<p>We can then render some UI from the values we use-query gives us back.</p>

```js
function App() {
  const {
    data: jobs = [],
    isLoading,
    isError,
  } = useQuery("graphql-jobs", async () => fetchData(GRAPHQL_JOBS_QUERY));
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Graphql Jobs</h1>
      {isLoading && <p>Fetching jobs...</p>}
      {isError && <p>:( failed to fetch graphql jobs</p>}
      <ul>
        {jobs.map(({ id, title, description }) => (
          <li key={id}>
            <h3>{title}</h3>
            <p>{description}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<p>
  And with that, we have a simple app that fetches graphql jobs and displays
  them with the benefits that react-query offers, among them being;
</p>

- Caching
- Deduping multiple requests for the same data into a single request
- Updating out of date data in the background
- Knowing when data is stale.
- Reflecting updates to data as quickly as possible
- Performance optimizations like pagination and lazy loading data
- Managing memory and garbage collection of server state
- Memoizing query results with structural sharing

##### What next?

<p>
  If you are new to react-query, I highly suggest going through its{" "}
  <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    docs and examples
  </a>
  . It does offer a lot more than what I have shown on here.
</p>
<p>
  If you are getting started with graphql, I'd recommend going through the{" "}
  <a href="http://howtographql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    how-to graphql tutorial
  </a>
  .
</p>

<p>
  After going through the above resources, the best way to better grasp what you
  learn is by building something. So go ahead and build something.

  Happy coding
